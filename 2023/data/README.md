| Sector | Count |
| :----- | ----: |
| Government (and related) | 130 |
| Private sector | 64 |
| Civil society | 46 |
| Academia | 37 |
| United Nations* | 25 |

Further, **147/ 302** (48.7%) of these partners were considered new to UNDP in country, a majority of which were from the private sector. Note this number was skewed by the high number of government partners (almost a third of all partnerships), which were indeed traditional partners for UNDP. When looking at other categories, there were much higher proportions of new partners, for example **75%** for the private sector, **64.8%** for academia, and **60.9%** for civil society. A full breakdown is shown in Table 2.
