Among other activities carried out throughout 2023, the AccLab is part of the Advisory Committee for the National Citizen Science Program and co-coordinated the evaluation of grants for projects in that program. 

We partnered with the Ministry of Education of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires to promote the establishment of the 'Citizen Science in Schools Program' along with the Center for Research on the Sea and the Atmosphere (CIMA-CONICET-UBA), Institute of Physical Chemistry of Materials, Environment, and Energy (INQUIMAE-CONICET-UBA), and the Department of Physics-Exact Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires. This program deploys three citizen science projects in 57 schools, involving more than 100 teachers and 1,000 students to measure the city's air quality using passive tubes installed in strategically located schools; monitor, forecast, and generate weather alerts related to hydro-meteorological events; and map the Earth's magnetic field using a mobile application. 

The experiments were conducted in and with the support of the municipal governments of Quilmes, San Antonio de Areco, Mercedes and Balcarce. Lastly, we will present the report with the results of the experiment along with the Argentine Network of Municipalities against Climate Change which gathers 286 local governments, highlighting the innovative quality of this approach and how useful cities found it",Yes

a. Design Inclusive Solutions Mapping Cards.

On-site consultation with communities is required to bring our Solutions Mapping cards to life efficiently and receive context-based feedback from communities.

Solutions Mapping Platform (Website). The refined tools, including the curated grassroots and social innovations, will be published on the Solutions Mapping website platform so that they can be accessed by the wider community.

Solutions Mapping Dissemination Event. Our learnings will be disseminated publicly to introduce our Solutions Mapping tools and highlight the importance of mundane and daily solutions to communities.
