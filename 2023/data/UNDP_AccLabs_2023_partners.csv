In some cases, we were able to map solutions with their help. We also talked to organizations that work on open hardware. 

Three of the organizations with which we worked were selected by the campaign “People Powered” (https://www.undp.org/acceleratorlabs/peoplepowered/solutions). These were “Litro de Luz”, “The Green Box”, and “500Rpm”. The first organization uses recycled plastic bottles and locally sourced materials to illuminate homes, businesses, and streets; The Green Box uses allelopathy to keep fruits and vegetables fresh, and 500 Rpm works on cheap wind turbines that can be built and replicated because they are open patent. 

We began to collaborate with an environmental organization called EcoHouse, which showed a great interest in the findings resulting from the mapping of solutions. That's why we have been in contact with them regarding the solutions, aiming to promote new opportunities for networking. Additionally, we will be presenting our findings in a diploma program on renewable energies at a national public university.  

Also, we have maintained preparatory meetings with EcoAndina, an organization based in the northern Andean region of Argentina. This organization aims at the developing of clean energy solutions mainly for the local communities. During these meetings with the EcoAndina team, we have assessed current practices and identified existing gaps related to the implementation of clean energy solutions.
